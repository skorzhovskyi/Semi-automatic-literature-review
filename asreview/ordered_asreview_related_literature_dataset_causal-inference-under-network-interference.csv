1,"We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter θ_0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η_0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η_0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η_0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η_0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ_0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η_0 into estimating equations for θ_0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N^(-1/2) consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ_0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ_0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N^(-1/2)-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.","[{'authorId': '26331346', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': ['Victor Chernozhukov']}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/26331346', 'name': 'V.

2,"In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit’s attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit’s outcome. The challenge is that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.","[{'authorId': '2631417', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': ['Susan Athey']}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2631417', 'name': 'S.

4,"The network interference model for causal inference places all experimental units at the vertices of an undirected exposure graph, such that treatment assigned to one unit may affect the outcome of another unit if and only if these two units are connected by an edge. This model has recently gained popularity as means of incorporating interference effects into the Neyman--Rubin potential outcomes framework; and several authors have considered estimation of various causal targets, including the direct and indirect effects of treatment. In this paper, we consider large-sample asymptotics for treatment effect estimation under network interference in a setting where the exposure graph is a random draw from a graphon. When targeting the direct effect, we show that---in our setting---popular estimators are considerably more accurate than existing results suggest, and provide a central limit theorem in terms of moments of the graphon. Meanwhile, when targeting the indirect effect, we leverage our generative assumptions to propose a consistent estimator in a setting where no other consistent estimators are currently available. We also show how our results can be used to conduct a practical assessment of the sensitivity of randomized study inference to potential interference effects. Overall, our results highlight the promise of random graph asymptotics in understanding the practicality and limits of causal inference under network interference.","[{'authorId': '104188017', 'externalIds': {}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/104188017', 'name': 'Shuangning Li', 'aliases': None, 'affiliations': [], 'homepage': None, 'paperCount': 13, 'citationCount': 64, 'hIndex': 4}, {'authorId': '3160667', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': ['Stefan Wager']}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/3160667', 'name': 'Stefan Wager', 'aliases': ['Stefan Wager'], 'affiliations': [], 'homepage': None, 'paperCount': 112, 'citationCount': 6464, 'hIndex': 29}]",25,"{'MAG': '3044422675', 'ArXiv': '2007.13302', 'DOI': '10.1214/22-aos2191', 'CorpusId': 220793511}",['Mathematics'],3,TRUE,{'name': 'The Annals of Statistics'},9991bad8f963d598aaf758ad4f523fe21e2ca714,2020-07-27,,42,"[{'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Random graph asymptotics for treatment effect estimation under network interference,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9991bad8f963d598aaf758ad4f523fe21e2ca714,Annals of Statistics,2020,1,5,2.777777778
5,"ABSTRACT We study the calculation of exact p-values for a large class of nonsharp null hypotheses about treatment effects in a setting with data from experiments involving members of a single connected network. The class includes null hypotheses that limit the effect of one unit’s treatment status on another according to the distance between units, for example, the hypothesis might specify that the treatment status of immediate neighbors has no effect, or that units more than two edges away have no effect. We also consider hypotheses concerning the validity of sparsification of a network (e.g., based on the strength of ties) and hypotheses restricting heterogeneity in peer effects (so that, e.g., only the number or fraction treated among neighboring units matters). Our general approach is to define an artificial experiment, such that the null hypothesis that was not sharp for the original experiment is sharp for the artificial experiment, and such that the randomization analysis for the artificial experiment is validated by the design of the original experiment.","[{'authorId': '2631417', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': ['Susan Athey']}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2631417', 'name': 'S.

 We propose a novel approach for constructing effective treatment policies when the observed data is biased and lacks counterfactual information. Learning in settings where the observed data does not contain all possible outcomes for all treatments is difficult since the observed data is typically biased due to existing clinical guidelines. This is an important problem in the medical domain as collecting unbiased data is expensive and so learning from the wealth of existing biased data is a worthwhile task. Our approach separates the problem into two stages: first we reduce the bias by learning a representation map using a novel auto-encoder network---this allows us to control the trade-off between the bias-reduction and the information loss---and then we construct effective treatment policies on the transformed data using a novel feedforward network. Separation of the problem into these two stages creates an algorithm that can be adapted to the problem at hand---the bias-reduction step can be performed as a preprocessing step for other algorithms. We compare our algorithm against state-of-art algorithms on two semi-synthetic datasets and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in performance.

3,"The broad adoption of social media has generated interest in leveraging peer inuence for inducing desired user behavior. Quantifying the causal effect of peer inuence presents technical challenges, however, including how to deal with social interference, complex response functions and network uncertainty. In this paper, we extend potential outcomes to allow for interference, we introduce well-defined causal estimands of peer-inuence, and we develop two estimation procedures: a frequentist procedure relying on a sequential randomization design that requires knowledge of the network but operates under complicated response functions, and a Bayesian procedure which accounts for network uncertainty but relies on a linear response assumption to increase estimation precision.

6,"We consider inference about the causal effect of a treatment or exposure in the presence of interference, i.e., when one individual’s treatment affects the outcome of another individual. In the observational setting where the treatment assignment mechanism is not known, inverse probability-weighted estimators have been proposed when individuals can be partitioned into groups such that there is no interference between individuals in different groups. Unfortunately this assumption, which is sometimes referred to as partial interference, may not hold, and moreover existing weighted estimators may have large variances. In this paper we consider weighted estimators that could be employed when interference is present. We first propose a generalized inverse probability-weighted estimator and two Hájek-type stabilized weighted estimators that allow any form of interference. We derive their asymptotic distributions and propose consistent variance estimators assuming partial interference. Empirical results show that one of the Hájek estimators can have substantially smaller finite-sample variance than the other estimators. The different estimators are illustrated using data on the effects of rotavirus vaccination in Nicaragua.","[{'authorId': '120095807', 'externalIds': {}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/120095807', 'name': 'L.

In this setting, the network and covariates of all units can be potential sources of confounding, in contrast to existing work that assumes confounding is limited to a known, low-dimensional function of these objects. To estimate the first-stage nuisance functions of the doubly robust estimator, we propose to use graph neural networks, which are designed to approximate functions of graph-structured inputs.

7,"Interference occurs when the treatment (or exposure) of one individual affects the outcomes of others. In some settings, it may be reasonable to assume that individuals can be partitioned into clusters such that there is no interference between individuals in different clusters, that is, there is partial interference. In observational studies with partial interference, inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators have been something else different possible treatment effects. However, the validity of IPW estimators depends on the propensity score being known or correctly modelled. Alternatively, one can estimate the treatment effect using an outcome regression model. In this paper, we propose doubly robust (DR) estimators that utilize both models and are consistent and asymptotically normal if either model, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate the DR property of the proposed estimators and the efficiency gain of DR over IPW estimators when both models are correctly specified.

8,"In many observational studies in social science and medicine, individuals are connected in ways that affect the adoption and efficacy of interventions. One individual’s treatment and attributes may affect another individual’s treatment and outcome. In particular, this violates the commonly made stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). Interference is often heterogeneous, and an individual’s outcome is not only affected by how many, but also which, neighbors or connections are treated. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for heterogeneous partial interference that partitions units into subsets based on observables. We allow interactions to be heterogeneous across subsets, but homogeneous for individuals within a subset. In this framework, we propose a class of estimators for heterogeneous direct and spillover effects from observational data that are shown to be doubly robust, asymptotically normal, and semiparametric efficient. In addition, we discuss a bias-variance tradeoff between robustness to heterogeneous interference and estimation efficiency. We further propose consistent matchingbased variance estimators and hypothesis tests to determine the appropriate specification of interference structure.

22,"Abstract Suppose that we observe a population of causally connected units. On each unit at each time-point on a grid we observe a set of other units the unit is potentially connected with, and a unit-specific longitudinal data structure consisting of baseline and time-dependent covariates, a time-dependent treatment, and a final outcome of interest. The target quantity of interest is defined as the mean outcome for this group of units if the exposures of the units would be probabilistically assigned according to a known specified mechanism, where the latter is called a stochastic intervention. Causal effects of interest are defined as contrasts of the mean of the unit-specific outcomes under different stochastic interventions one wishes to evaluate. This covers a large range of estimation problems from independent units, independent clusters of units, and a single cluster of units in which each unit has a limited number of connections to other units. The allowed dependence includes treatment allocation in response to data on multiple units and so called causal interference as special cases. We present a few motivating classes of examples, propose a structural causal model, define the desired causal quantities, address the identification of these quantities from the observed data, and define maximum likelihood based estimators based on cross-validation. In particular, we present maximum likelihood based super-learning for this network data. Nonetheless, such smoothed/regularized maximum likelihood estimators are not targeted and will thereby be overly bias w.r.t. the target parameter, and, as a consequence, generally not result in asymptotically normally distributed estimators of the statistical target parameter. To formally develop estimation theory, we focus on the simpler case in which the longitudinal data structure is a point-treatment data structure. We formulate a novel targeted maximum likelihood estimator of this estimand and show that the double robustness of the efficient influence curve implies that the bias of the targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) will be a second-order term involving squared differences of two nuisance parameters. In particular, the TMLE will be consistent if either one of these nuisance parameters is consistently estimated. Due to the causal dependencies between units, the data set may correspond with the realization of a single experiment, so that establishing a (e.g. normal) limit distribution for the targeted maximum likelihood estimators, and corresponding statistical inference, is a challenging topic. We prove two formal theorems establishing the asymptotic normality using advances in weak-convergence theory. We conclude with a discussion and refer to an accompanying technical report for extensions to general longitudinal data structures.","[{'authorId': '3033525', 'name': 'M.

19,"Inferring causal effects from an observational study is challenging because participants are not randomized to treatment. Observational studies in infectious disease research present the additional challenge that one participant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i.e., there may be interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects in the presence of interference are considered, and new causal estimands designed specifically for use with observational studies are proposed. Previously defined estimands target counterfactual scenarios in which individuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in settings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it may be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in the same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe counterfactual scenarios in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as in the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in the individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for policy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of increasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse probability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The large-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented. The proposed methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a study of cholera vaccination in over 100,000 individuals in Bangladesh.","[{'authorId': '49001614', 'name': 'B.

11,"There has been growing interest in causal inference to study treatment effects under interference. While many estimators have been proposed, there is little work on studying efficiency-related optimality properties of these estimators. To this end, the paper presents semiparametrically efficient and doubly robust estimation of network treatment effects under interference. We focus on partial interference where study units are partitioned into non-overlapping clusters and there is interference within clusters, but not across clusters. We derive the efficient influence function and the semiparametric efficiency bound for a family of network causal effects that include the direct and the indirect/spillover effects. We also adapt M-estimation theory to interference settings and propose M-estimators which are locally efficient and doubly robust. We conclude by presenting some limited results on adaptive estimation to interference patterns, or commonly referred to as exposure mapping.","[{'authorId': '2115237536', 'name': 'Chan Park'}, {'authorId': '15618212', 'name': 'Hyunseung Kang'}]",5,"{'ArXiv': '2004.08950', 'MAG': '3017212421', 'CorpusId': 215827506}","['Mathematics', 'Computer Science']",1,FALSE,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'arXiv: Methodology'}",a8912dd443bdb219619b42dd1781a8e85ffe5287,2020-04-19,,74,"[{'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Network Treatment Effects Under Partial Interference,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8912dd443bdb219619b42dd1781a8e85ffe5287,,2020,1,12,0.5555555556
2572,"Given causal graph assumptions, intervention-specific counterfactual distributions of the data can be defined by the so called G-computation formula, which is obtained by carrying out these interventions on the likelihood of the data factorized according to the causal graph. The obtained G-computation formula represents the counterfactual distribution the data would have had if this intervention would have been enforced on the system generating the data. A causal effect of interest can now be defined as some difference between these counterfactual distributions indexed by different interventions. For example, the interventions can represent static treatment regimens or individualized treatment rules that assign treatment in response to time-dependent covariates, and the causal effects could be defined in terms of features of the mean of the treatment-regimen specific counterfactual outcome of interest as a function of the corresponding treatment regimens. Such features could be defined nonparametrically in terms of so called (nonparametric) marginal structural models for static or individualized treatment rules, whose parameters can be thought of as (smooth) summary measures of differences between the treatment regimen specific counterfactual distributions.In this article, we develop a particular targeted maximum likelihood estimator of causal effects of multiple time point interventions. This involves the use of loss-based super-learning to obtain an initial estimate of the unknown factors of the G-computation formula, and subsequently, applying a target-parameter specific optimal fluctuation function (least favorable parametric submodel) to each estimated factor, estimating the fluctuation parameter(s) with maximum likelihood estimation, and iterating this updating step of the initial factor till convergence. This iterative targeted maximum likelihood updating step makes the resulting estimator of the causal effect double robust in the sense that it is consistent if either the initial estimator is consistent, or the estimator of the optimal fluctuation function is consistent. The optimal fluctuation function is correctly specified if the conditional distributions of the nodes in the causal graph one intervenes upon are correctly specified. The latter conditional distributions often comprise the so called treatment and censoring mechanism. Selection among different targeted maximum likelihood estimators (e.g., indexed by different initial estimators) can be based on loss-based cross-validation such as likelihood based cross-validation or cross-validation based on another appropriate loss function for the distribution of the data. Some specific loss functions are mentioned in this article.Subsequently, a variety of interesting observations about this targeted maximum likelihood estimation procedure are made. This article provides the basis for the subsequent companion Part II-article in which concrete demonstrations for the implementation of the targeted MLE in complex causal effect estimation problems are provided.","[{'authorId': '3033525', 'name': 'M.

14,"In most real-world systems units are interconnected and can be represented as networks consisting of nodes and edges. For instance, in social systems individuals can have social ties, family or financial relationships. In settings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its effect spills over connected units, estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and spillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way and the extent to which spillover effects occur along the observed network are required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is not under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are potential threats to the identification and estimation of causal effects on networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood interference, which assumes interference operates only through a function of the immediate neighbors' treatments ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed using a penalized spline regression. Inference capitalizes on a three-step Bayesian procedure which allows to take into account the uncertainty in the propensity score estimation and avoiding model feedback. Finally, correlation of interacting units is taken into account using a community detection algorithm and incorporating random effects in the outcome model.","[{'authorId': '3410267', 'name': 'L.

1340,"In experimental design and causal inference, it may happen that the treatment is not defined on individual experimental units, but rather on pairs or, more generally, on groups of units. For example, teachers may choose pairs of students who do not know each other to teach a new curriculum; regulators might allow or disallow merging of firms, and biologists may introduce or inhibit interactions between genes or proteins. In this paper, we formalize this experimental setting, and we refer to the individual treatments in such setting as entangled treatments. We then consider the special case where individual treatments depend on a common population quantity, and develop theory and methodology to deal with this case. In our target applications, the common population quantity is a network, and the individual treatments are defined as functions of the change in the network between two specific time points. Our focus is on estimating the causal effect of entangled treatments in observational studies where entangled treatments are endogenous and cannot be directly manipulated. When treatment cannot be manipulated, be it entangled or not, it is necessary to account for the treatment assignment mechanism to avoid selection bias, commonly through a propensity score methodology. In this paper, we quantify the extent to which classical propensity score methodology ignores treatment entanglement, and characterize the bias in the estimated causal effects. To characterize such bias we introduce a novel similarity function between propensity score models, and a practical approximation of it, which we use to quantify model misspecification of propensity scores due to entanglement. One solution to avoid the bias in the presence of entangled treatments is to model the change in the network, directly, and calculate an individual unit's propensity score by averaging treatment assignments over this change.","[{'authorId': '1776973', 'name': 'Panos Toulis'}, {'authorId': '6974508', 'name': 'A.

17,"No man is an island, as individuals interact and influence one another daily in our society. When social influence takes place in experiments on a population of interconnected individuals, the treatment on a unit may affect the outcomes of other units, a phenomenon known as interference. This thesis develops a causal framework and inference methodology for experiments where interference takes place on a network of influence (i.e. network interference). In this framework, the network potential outcomes serve as the key quantity and flexible building blocks for causal estimands that represent a variety of primary, peer, and total treatment effects. These causal estimands are estimated via principled Bayesian imputation of missing outcomes. The theory on the unconfoundedness assumptions leading to simplified imputation highlights the importance of including relevant network covariates in the potential outcome model. Additionally, experimental designs that result in balanced covariates and sizes across treatment exposure groups further improve the causal estimate, especially by mitigating potential outcome model mis-specification. The true potential outcome model is not typically known in real-world experiments, so the best practice is to account for interference and confounding network covariates through both balanced designs and model-based imputation. A full factorial simulated experiment is formulated to demonstrate this principle by comparing performance across different randomization schemes during the design phase and estimators during the analysis phase, under varying network topology and true potential outcome models. Overall, this thesis asserts that interference is not just a nuisance for analysis but rather an opportunity for quantifying and leveraging peer effects in real-world experiments.","[{'authorId': '2186219', 'name': 'E.

20,"We study treatment effect modifiers for causal analysis in a social network, where neighbors’ characteristics or network structure may affect the outcome of a unit, and the goal is to identify sub-populations with varying treatment effects using such network properties. We propose a novel framework for this purpose that facilitates data-driven decision making by testing hypotheses about complex effect modifiers in terms of network features or network patterns (e.g., characteristics of neighbors of a unit or belonging to a triangle), and by identifying sub-populations for which a treatment is likely to be effective or harmful. We describe a hypothesis testing approach that accounts for a unit’s covariates, their neighbors’ covariates, and patterns in the social network, and devise an algorithm incorporating ideas from causal inference, hypothesis testing, and graph theory to verify a hypothesized effect modifier. In addition, we develop a novel algorithm for discovery of network patterns that are potential effect modifiers. We perform extensive experimental evaluations with a real development economics dataset about the treatment effect of belonging to a financial support network called self-help groups on risk tolerance, and also with a synthetic dataset with known ground truths simulating a vaccine efficacy trial, to evaluate our framework and algorithms.","[{'authorId': '32466098', 'name': 'Amir Gilad'}, {'authorId': '144881140', 'name': 'Harsh Parikh'}, {'authorId': '31938009', 'name': 'Sudeepa Roy'}, {'authorId': '145674068', 'name': 'Babak Salimi'}]",1,"{'ArXiv': '2105.10591', 'CorpusId': 243848030}",['Computer Science'],0,FALSE,,98177701c97aea7204944ce3ec7b9e5617eddab5,2021-05-21,,71,"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Social Networks,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98177701c97aea7204944ce3ec7b9e5617eddab5,,2021,1,21,0.25
12,"Treatment interference (i.e., one unit’s potential outcomes depend on other units’ treatment) is prevalent in social settings. Ignoring treatment interference can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects and incorrect statistical inferences. Some recent studies have started to incorporate treatment interference into causal inference. But treatment interference is often assumed to follow a simple structure (e.g., treatment interference exists only within groups) or measured in a simplistic way (e.g., only based on the number of treated friends). In this paper, I highlight the importance of collecting data on actual treatment diffusion in order to more accurately measure treatment interference. Furthermore, I show that with accurate measures of treatment interference, we can identify and estimate a series of causal effects that are previously unavailable, including the direct treatment effect, treatment interference effect, and treatment effect on interference. I illustrate the methods through a case study of a social network–based smoking prevention intervention.","[{'authorId': '39412718', 'name': 'Weihua An'}]",6,"{'MAG': '2883393037', 'DOI': '10.1177/0081175018785216', 'CorpusId': 125488826}",['Computer Science'],4,FALSE,"{'volume': '48', 'pages': '152 - 181', 'name': 'Sociological Methodology'}",c5dc491ace4c33f1eff622d0f14dc062861e77d8,2018-07-25,['JournalArticle'],63,"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Psychology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Causal Inference with Networked Treatment Diffusion,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5dc491ace4c33f1eff622d0f14dc062861e77d8,Sociological methodology,2018,1,13,0.24
10,"Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments or observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment responses under interference. Hence, how to estimate the superimposed causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference becomes a challenging task in causal inference. In this work, we study causal effect estimation under general network interference using GNNs, which are powerful tools for capturing the dependency in the graph. After deriving causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference and treatment capacity constraint. Furthermore, a heuristic graph structure-dependent error bound for GNN-based causal estimators is provided.","[{'authorId': '10684484', 'name': 'Yunpu Ma'}, {'authorId': '2115640193', 'name': 'Yuyi Wang'}, {'authorId': '1700754', 'name': 'Volker Tresp'}]",2,"{'MAG': '3006810387', 'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2002-08506', 'CorpusId': 211204985}",['Computer Science'],0,FALSE,"{'volume': 'abs/2002.08506', 'name': 'ArXiv'}",513b312990a2642cf595ff2bda906a0fcfbb64ec,2020-02-20,['JournalArticle'],37,"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Causal Inference under Networked Interference,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/513b312990a2642cf595ff2bda906a0fcfbb64ec,ArXiv,2020,1,11,0.2222222222
23,"Online network experiments have become widely-used methods to estimate spillover effects and study online social influence. In such experiments, the spillover effects often arise not only through an online network of interest but also through a face-to-face network. Social scientists are therefore often interested in measuring the importance of online human interactions by estimating the spillover effects specific to the online network, separately from spillover effects attributable to the offline network. However, the unbiased estimation of these network-specific spillover effects requires an often-violated assumption that researchers observe all relevant networks; they cannot observe the offline network in many applications. In this paper, we derive an exact expression of bias due to unobserved networks. Unlike the conventional omitted variable bias, this bias for the network-specific spillover effect remains even when treatment assignment is randomized and when unobserved networks and the network of interest are independently generated. By incorporating this bias into the estimation, we also develop parametric and nonparametric sensitivity analysis methods, with which researchers can examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of unmeasured networks. We analyze a political mobilization experiment on the Twitter network and find that an estimate of the Twitter-specific spillover effect is sensitive to assumptions about an unobserved face-to-face network.","[{'authorId': '18350081', 'name': 'Naoki Egami'}]",7,"{'MAG': '2752987192', 'CorpusId': 88517535}",['Mathematics'],0,FALSE,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'arXiv: Methodology'}",524e27002534c6021b32fc5d488f6c75fd6b85ac,2017-08-28,,45,"[{'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Unbiased Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis for Network-Specific Spillover Effects: Application to An Online Network Experiment,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/524e27002534c6021b32fc5d488f6c75fd6b85ac,,2017,1,24,0.1944444444
2214,"Suppose that we observe a population of causally connected units according to a network. On each unit we observe a set of potentially connected units that contains the true connections, and a longitudinal data structure, which includes timedependent exposure or treatment, time-dependent covariates, a final outcome of interest. The target quantity of interest is defined as the mean outcome for this group of units if the exposures of the units would be probabilistically assigned according to a known specified mechanism, where the latter is called a stochastic intervention. Causal effects of interest are defined as contrasts of the mean of the unit specific outcomes under different stochastic interventions one wishes to evaluate. By varying the network structure, this covers a large range of estimation problems ranging from independent units, independent clusters of units, anda single cluster of units in which each unit has a limited number of connections to other units. We present a few motivating classes of examples, propose a structural causal model, define the desired causal quantities, address the identification of these quantities from the observed data, and define maximum likelihood based estimators based on cross-validation. Such smoothed/regularized maximum likelihood estimators are not targeted and will thereby be overly bias w.r.t. the target parameter, and, as a consequence, generally not result in asymptotically normally distributed estimators of the statistical target parameter. Therefore, we formulated targeted maximum likelihood estimators of this estimand, and showed that the robustness of the efficient influence curve implies that the bias of the TMLE will be a second order term involving squared differences of two nuisance parameters. In order to deal with the curse of dimensionality, we present super-learning based on cross-validation, and we develop targeted maximum likelihood estimators, which are less biased than maximum likelihood estimators due to a targeted bias reduction step. Due to the causal dependencies between units, the data set may correspond with the realization of a single experiment, so that establishing a (e.g., normal) limit distribution for the estimators, and corresponding statistical inference, is a challenging topic. In order to establish a formal theorem, we focus on the point-treatment longitudinal data structure, thereby also putting down a foundation for its generalization to the general longitudinal data structure, which we reserve for future research.We conclude with a discussion.","[{'authorId': '123193912', 'name': 'V.

2216,"We consider policy evaluations when SUTVA is violated because of the presence of interference among units. We propose to explicitly model interactions as a function of units characteristics. Our approach is applied to the evaluation of a policy implemented in Tuscany (a region in Italy) on small handicraft firms. Results show that the benefits from the policy are reduced when treated firms are subject to high levels of interference. Moreover, the average causal effect is slightly underestimated when interference is ignored. These findings point to the importance of considering possible interference among units when evaluating and planning policy interventions.","[{'authorId': '1884830', 'name': 'B.

13,"Estimates of individual treatment effects from networked observational data are attracting increasing attention these days. One major challenge in network scenarios is the violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which assumes that the treatment assignment of a unit does not influence others’ outcomes. In network data, due to interference, the outcome of a unit is influenced not only by its treatment (i.e., direct effects) but also by others’ treatments (i.e., spillover effects). Furthermore, the influences from other units are always heterogeneous (e.g., friends with similar interests affect a person differently than friends with different inter-ests). In this paper, we focus on the problem of estimating individual treatment effects (both direct and spillover effects) under heterogeneous interference. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Weighting Regression (DWR) algorithm by simultaneously learning attention weights that capture the heterogeneous interference and sample weights to eliminate the complex confounding bias in networks. We formulate the entire learning process as a bi-level optimization problem. In theory, we present generalization error bounds for individual treatment effect estimation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DWR algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for estimating individual treatment effects under heterogeneous interference.","[{'authorId': '2117928326', 'name': 'Ziyu Zhao'}, {'authorId': '33870528', 'name': 'Kun Kuang'}, {'authorId': '50824401', 'name': 'Ruoxuan Xiong'}, {'authorId': '93192602', 'name': 'Fei Wu'}]",0,"{'ArXiv': '2210.14080', 'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2210-14080', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2210.14080', 'CorpusId': 253107774}","['Computer Science', 'Mathematics']",0,FALSE,"{'volume': 'abs/2210.14080', 'name': 'ArXiv'}",00102916233d568656659b8263efb6d8fb4a46d6,2022-10-25,['JournalArticle'],31,"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",Learning Individual Treatment Effects under Heterogeneous Interference in Networks,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00102916233d568656659b8263efb6d8fb4a46d6,ArXiv,2022,1,14,0
15,"In most real-world systems units are interconnected and can be represented as networks consisting of nodes and edges. For instance, in social systems individuals can have social ties, family or financial relationships. In settings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its effects spills over connected units, estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and spillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way and the extent to which spillover effects occur along the observed network are required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is not under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are potential threats to the identification and estimation of causal effects on networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood interference, which assumes interference to operate only through a function of the the immediate neighbors' treatments, ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed using a penalized spline regression. Inference capitalizes on a three-step Bayesian procedure which allows taking into account the uncertainty in the propensity score estimation and avoiding model feedback. Finally, correlation of interacting units is taken into account using a community detection algorithm and incorporating random effects in the outcome model. All these sources of variability, including variability of treatment assignment, are accounted for in the posterior distribution of finite-sample causal estimands.","[{'authorId': '3410267', 'name': 'L.

18,". Estimating causal eﬀects has become an integral part of most applied ﬁelds. Solving these modern causal questions requires tackling violations of many classical causal assumptions. In this work we consider the violation of the classical no-interference assumption, meaning that the treatment of one individuals might aﬀect the outcomes of another. To make interference tractable, we consider a known network that describes how interference may travel. However, unlike previous work in this area, the radius (and intensity) of the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on diﬀerent sub-networks of those treated and untreated that are connected to this unit. We study estimators for the average direct treatment eﬀect on the treated in such a setting. The proposed estimator builds upon a Lepski-like procedure that searches over the possible relevant radii and treatment assignment patterns. In contrast to previous work, the proposed procedure aims to approximate the relevant network interference patterns. We establish oracle inequalities and corresponding adaptive rates for the estimation of the interference function. We leverage such estimates to propose and analyze two estimators for the average direct treatment eﬀect on the treated. We address several challenges steaming from the data-driven creation of the patterns (i.e. feature engineering) and the network dependence. In addition to rates of convergence, under mild reg-ularity conditions, we show that one of the proposed estimators is asymptotically normal and unbiased.","[{'authorId': '3026075', 'name': 'A.

1443,"In randomized experiments, interactions between units might generate a treatment diffusion process. This is common when the treatment of interest is an actual object or product that can be shared among peers (e.g., flyers, booklets, videos). For instance, if the intervention of interest is an information campaign realized through the distribution of a video to targeted individuals, some of these treated individuals might share the video they received with their friends. Such a phenomenon is usually unobserved, causing a misallocation of individuals in the two treatment arms: some of the initially untreated units might have actually received the treatment by diffusion. Treatment misclassification can, in turn, introduce a bias in the estimation of the causal effect. Inspired by a recent field experiment on the effect of different types of school incentives aimed at encouraging students to attend cultural events, we present a novel approach to deal with a hidden diffusion process on observed or partially observed networks. Specifically, we develop a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that assesses the robustness of the estimates against the possible presence of a treatment diffusion. We simulate several diffusion scenarios within a plausible range of sensitivity parameters and we compare the treatment effect which is estimated in each scenario with the one that is obtained while ignoring the diffusion process. Results suggest that even a treatment diffusion parameter of small size may lead to a significant bias in the estimation of the treatment effect.","[{'authorId': '2127071448', 'name': ""Costanza Tort'u""}, {'authorId': '3020257', 'name': 'I.
